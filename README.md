 It's a virtual plant! (work in progress)

 Practice your gardening skills with this virtual plant that lives on your desktop. No sunlight required!

 Right click your plant to give it water and show it love <3

Keep it happy and watch it grow! Neglect it for long enough and see it shrivel up :(


 Transparent window only works on Windows (for now). Drying out speeds are slightly sped up for testing purposes.
